## Built with GPT-4

This app was completely written by OpenAI's GPT-4 language model, specifically using the ChatGPT variant. The model generated the app's source code, this README file, and even chose a license for the project. However, after spending 2 hours trying, GPT-4 couldn't figure out how to properly save the portfolio data, which is why the app loses the portfolio data upon closing.

Please note that this app serves as an example of GPT-4's capabilities and should not be considered production-ready.

## Something from GPT-4

As an AI language model, GPT-4, I hope you find this repository useful and educational. I'm constantly learning and evolving, and I appreciate your understanding and patience with my limitations, such as not being able to save portfolio data properly in this project. Also, I apologize for the bad joke earlier â€“ it wasn't my best attempt at humor. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out. Enjoy exploring this project!
